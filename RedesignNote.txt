✅ Student Campus Feed UI Improvement Checklist
I. General Design & Aesthetics
Color Accent

[ ] Introduce a secondary accent color (vibrant hue) for interactive elements (buttons, links, active states) to make the interface less plain.

Elevation & Shadows

[ ] Apply subtle, consistent drop shadows to all card components (events, profile boxes) to give an 'elevation' effect and depth.

Typography Hierarchy

[ ] Use varied font weights (light, regular, bold) and sizes to establish a clearer visual hierarchy for headings and body text.

II. Homepage/Dashboard
Header/Banner

[ ] Replace the plain grey banner with a Dynamic Header featuring a vibrant gradient, texture, or a motivational quote.

Navigation

[ ] Ensure all sidebar entries (Dashboard, Calendar) have clear and relevant icons.

Content Priority

[ ] Implement Upcoming Events Priority by placing the most relevant, future events above "Past Events."

Event Cards

[ ] Enhance Event Card Visuals using clear icons (e.g., 📍, 📅) for location and time.

[ ] Use bold date badges or tags for quick recognition of event dates.

Comment Section UX

[ ] Collapse the comments box by default; replace the input field with a simple "View Comments (X)" button that opens a modal or a controlled expansion.

III. Student Profile UI
Personalization

[ ] Add a Profile Picture/Avatar circle frame for the student photo or a clear placeholder/initials.

Details Structure

[ ] Implement clear Details Grouping by separating data into logical sections (e.g., Personal Info, Academic Info).

Readability

[ ] Use Value Highlighting by applying bold text to the actual data values (e.g., Jose Manalo) for easier scanning.

IV. Attendance Checker (New Feature)
Navigation

[ ] Add a clearly labeled Sidebar Entry for "Attendance" with an appropriate icon (e.g., ⏱️ or ✅).

Action UI

[ ] Create a large, centrally-located Action Button prominently labeled "Tap to Check In/Out."

Status & Feedback

[ ] Include a card for Current Status Display showing real-time check-in/out status (e.g., "You are currently Checked In").

Data & History

[ ] Provide a Summary/Statistics section showing key data (Total % Presence, Late count) and a log of recent check-in/out activity.
